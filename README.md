# SE-Assignment-2
Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:
Define Software Engineering:

Answer: Software engineering is the branch of computer science that deals with designing, developing, testing and maintainance of the software applications

What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming?
Answer: Software engineering utilizes computer science  mathematical and fundamental engineering principles to construct the instructions of a software program that is intended to solve particular problem in the society while programing have narrower focus that involve writing codes to instruct software program how and when top execute specific functions to deliver on a predetermined set of outcomes

Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC): SDLC is the cost effective and time efficient process of development of teams used to design, buld and maintain high quality software

Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.
Answer: There are 6 main pahses of the SDLC:
Plan: The planning phase  of SDLS involve identification of the problem, scheduling resource and allocation, defination of the goal of the software and detailed plan of how to archive the goals

Design: In design phase of the SDLC the engineers analyze and identify the best solutions to create user friend and functioning software

Implement: in implementation phase of SDLC developments team develop code for solving the identified problem through the software

Test: in the testing phse of SDLC the development team utilize manual and automatic testing methods to cgeck for the errors and bugs

Deploy: In the phase of deployment the software engineer release the tested version of the software to be used by the end users

Maintain: The final stage of SDLC involve fixing of errors and bugs that has been missed snd those that will occurs in the future to ensure smooth users experience

Agile vs. Waterfall Models:
The agile mode of SDLC arranges the phases into several developments cyscles tthat are carried out  by team through iteration and derivering small increment of each phse in the cycle while Waterfall all phases of SDLC are exucuted sequentially so that each of the formal step complete and new phase depends on the outcome of the previously phase

Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?
Answer:
In waterfall mode each of all phase are occuared sequentilly while in Agile mode each phase can take place at the same time ad independently to the outcome of other phase
Its easy to address the issue in Agile mode while its diffult to perform the changes in waterfall once the phase is completed
Waterfall is suitable for the small project that its requirements can be pre defined for a example designing e comercy website while is suitable for the complex projects th are subjected to on going change for example development of AI model


Requirements Engineering:
Iss the systematic approach of identifyng, documentig and verification of the requirement for a software systems to guarantee  the effective creation of a software product

What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.
Answer: Process of requirements engineering
1. Feasibility strudy. This step main focus on analysis of the requarement of economic, technical and operational feasibility. This step is cruatial in assessing whether availbale resources can provide result for intended software

2. Requament elicitation: This steps involves variously ways to gain knowledge and skills about the project domain and requirements

3. Requarement specification: This step is used to produce both functional and non functional requiremets for the software

requirement verification and validation: Verification it refers to set of task that ensures that the software correctly implements a specific function
Validation it refers to a dirrefent set of task that ensure the software has been buits is traceable to custumer requirements

Requirement management:  Is the process of analyzing, documenting, tracking, prioritizing and agreeing on the requirement and controlling the communication with the relevant stake holders 

Software Design Principles:

Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?
Testing in Software Engineering:

Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?
Version Control Systems:

What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.
Software Project Management:

Discuss the role of a software project manager. What are some key responsibilities and challenges faced in managing software projects?
Software Maintenance:

Define software maintenance and explain the different types of maintenance activities. Why is maintenance an essential part of the software lifecycle?
Ethical Considerations in Software Engineering:

What are some ethical issues that software engineers might face? How can software engineers ensure they adhere to ethical standards in their work?
Submission Guidelines:
Your answers should be well-structured, concise, and to the point.
Provide real-world examples or case studies wherever possible.
Cite any references or sources you use in your answers.
Submit your completed assignment by [due date].
